You can **subscribe** to published **event types** by registering webhooks and
will then be **notified** when any matching events are published that match the
given sales unit id.

As an example, a merchant can register a callback url to receive a callback when
any of the payments of the merchant is captured.

There is a set limit on how many registrations per event types per sales unit
allowed, see the API reference for the exact limit.
