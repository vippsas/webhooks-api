# Webhooks API [BETA]

ðŸ’¥ Work in progress ðŸ’¥

An API to register one or more callback urls per named event per sales unit.

As an example a merchant can register a callback url for receiving a callback
when any of the payments of the merchant is captured.

There is a set limit on how many registrations per event types per sales unit
allowed, see the API reference for the exact limit.
